# ❄️ Icy Tower Clone - Phaser + TypeScript

A vertical platformer game built with **Phaser 3** and **TypeScript**, inspired by the classic *Icy Tower*. Keep jumping on randomly generated platforms to climb as high as you can. Avoid deadly traps, falling debris, and don’t fall below the screen—or it's game over!

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- **Endless vertical jumping gameplay** – the higher you go, the higher your score!
- **Platform Types**:
  - 🧱 **Normal platforms** – stable and safe.
  - 🧊 **Crumbling platforms** – they collapse shortly after being stepped on.
- **Hazards**:
  - 🪨 **Falling debris** – randomly drops from above and can kill the player on contact.
  - ⚙️ **Buzz saws** – move horizontally between platforms and will slice the player on touch.
- **Permadeath fall** – if you fall below the lowest visible platform, you die.
- **Score system** – tracks how high you've climbed.
